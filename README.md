Code problems throughout:

* Struggled connecting my code to GitHub, every time I pushed a commit, it failed with the same error - I fixed this by changing the branch in GitHub Pages through the settings. By updating this to the correct folder, I was then able to push through my commits without fail.
* I couldn't open each page through the internal or external browser, I used "pages/page_2.html" etc, and I changed this to "page_2.html" etc in order for this to work when switching pages within the website.
* My CSS wasn't connected to the website and so the styling was not on any page. I used "styles/global.css" I updated this to "../styles/global.css" in order for this to connect to every page.
